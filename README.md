# Utrecht City Color Palette

The Dutch city Utrecht is one of the most beautiful places in the world, and a beacon of art and education, housing more than 21 universities and colleges and 400 art installations. With this package I transform street art found in Utrecht into color palettes which you can use for plots generated in R.
